# Mousetrap
Trap the mouse pointer and buttons in a Window, temporarily.<br>
Works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10 x32 and x64 alike.<br>
<br>
Press ESC to end & release.<br>
Also there is a timeout. <br>
<br>
# USECASE
If you just want to double click to trap and your mouse to (for example) pysically clean it ( perhaps with denatured alcohol... ).<br>
Actually also traps the basic layout of your keyboard - except for the ESCape key (Win, ALT+Tab and special shortcuts like that are not trapped).<br>
<br>
<b><i>        Happy cleaning! </i></b><br>
